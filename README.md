# Project Name: JDBCProject1
### About my Project

* First I create a database book_data in my local server (Laptop). 
* Then, I create two table named books and publisher.
* In the books table, I create five Columns named id, book_name, author, genre and publish_year. I also provide relevant data for this table.
* In the publisher table, I create four Columns named id, publisher_name, contact_email and foreign key book_id. I also provide relevant data for this table.
* After that, I create connection with Data Base from my code.
* Then I join books and publisher table with the book id.
* Finally, I write code for shoe the Book ID, Publisher Name, Contact Email, Book Name, Author and Genre for each match data.
